Some experts distinguish between turnover and attrition. Judging by the data, we will have to work with something in between - any employee departure from the company. But in general, both attrition and turnover problems would be solved the same way, except that turnover would also require data on the labor market surrounding the company.  \n\nIf you want to know the difference between turnover and attrition, check out these links:  \nhttps://sprigghr.com/blog/hr-professionals/employee-attrition-vs-employee-turnover/  \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-turnover-vs-attrition-david-o-bryant/  \n\nLeaving a company is often the result of long deliberation. Abrupt and spontaneous withdrawals are rather rare. Therefore, it is not entirely correct to require a deterministic prediction from the solution. The employee is still working today, but he has already made a decision to leave the company, which he will announce tomorrow. In the data, this will be noted as if the employee is working, although in fact it is rather the other way around. It would be more correct to present this task as a regression problem. \n\nIn addition, the presented data is imbalanced - there are five times more records in `attrition-no` class than in `attrition-yes` class. This creates additional difficulties for creating a predictive model. \nThis data is a nice exmaple of *accuracy paradox* - by simply predicting each case as an `attrition-no`, we already get an accuracy of about 84%. But recall and precision for another class will always be very low. \n\nFor the above reasons, this problem, in my opinion, does not have a real solution. \n\n**I think that for the above reasons, this problem has no real solution.**\n\nHowever, I will show you how I've tried to solve this problem:\n1. Feature analysis - *How I analyzed the features and highlighted the most important ones*\n2. Trying to solve problem using under- and over-sampling - *How I tried to solve the problem of data imbalance using under- and over-sampling*","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-26T11:28:33.553101Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-26T11:28:33.553597Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-26T11:28:33.56888Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-09-26T11:28:33.553555Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-26T11:28:33.567137Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## List of attributes:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prepare tools","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import data analysis and plotting tools \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# enable drawing plots in jupyter\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# processing data\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# import models from scikit-learn\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# import model evaluations\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-04T14:32:54.429808Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-04T14:32:54.430426Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-04T14:32:55.395951Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-04T14:32:54.430323Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-04T14:32:55.394731Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv\")\npd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\", None)\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-04T14:33:20.277274Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-04T14:33:20.277703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-04T14:33:20.362254Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-04T14:33:20.277665Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-04T14:33:20.361145Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here some features that we need to remove:\n1. `EmployeeNumber` - it's a some sort id for employee, which won't help us.\n2.

a company is often the result of long deliberation. Abrupt and spontaneous withdrawals are rather rare. Therefore, it is not entirely correct to require a deterministic prediction from the solution. The employee is still working today, but he has already made a decision to leave the company, which he will announce tomorrow. In the data, this will be noted as if the employee is working, although in fact it is rather the other way around. It would be more correct to present this task as a regression problem.\n\nIn addition, the presented data is imbalanced - there are five times more records in attrition-no class than in attrition-yes class. This creates additional difficulties for creating a predictive model. This data is a nice exmaple of accuracy paradox - by simply predicting each case as an attrition-no, we already get an accuracy of about 84%. But recall and precision for another class will always be very low.\n\nFor the above reasons, this problem, in my opinion, does not have a real solution. \n\nHowever, resampling data let me get relatively high f1-score comparing to other way that I've tried.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}}
